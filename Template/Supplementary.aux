Among the 15 m/z values with top-ranked correlation coefficients, 7 of them are successfully identified within a tolerance window of 5 ppm. For example, the m/z value 774.5983 indicates 16 potential phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine metabolites. The m/z 804.6077 is identified as 12 potential compounds that belong to the class of glycerophospholipids and previously identified in prostate cancer samples in the database, Metabolomics Workbench (https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org), with study IDs ST000784 and ST001133. As for the m/z 762.5862, it is identified as a neutral glycosphingolipids compound. \relax }}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }

As checked with the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), the LIPID MAPSÂ® Structure Database (LMSD) and the MetaboAnalyst database, 9 out of 14 are successfully identified. For instance, m/z 858.5260627 is identified as compounds belonging to the class of phosphatidylserines with a tolerance window of 5 ppm. These compounds are speculated to be related to the vigorous phospholipid metabolism of colorectal cancer cells. Nevertheless, there is no relevant report on phosphatidylserine compounds as markers for colorectal cancer. \relax }}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
